Chris Paterno kindly pointed out to me that the curruption in my image was caused by
floating point numbers exceeding their max or min values.


Implementation:
---------------

To my knowledge everything is working correctly. Gradescope refuses to compile
the image program however everything works fine on the hw server. I am going to
assume this is an issue with the auto grader and pray I am correct in this assumtion.


Architecture:
-------------

I followed my design document pretty closely so please refer to DESIGN for more details.
One exception to this was to add a structures.h file to define all the shared data
structures for my project.

My code is kind of garbage though, this whole online classes thing has thrown my already
dubious time management skills for a loop. I would have cleaned everything up and added
more comments if I had more time. 


Time:
-----

I would say I spent at least 30 hours on this project.
